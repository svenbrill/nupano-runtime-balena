  NUPANO runtime using BalenaOS integrated in BalenaCloud.
post-provisioning: >-
  OEMs need and want to differentiate themselves from competition  by integrating IT software in their machines and plants. NUPANO is a tool for machine builders to integrate and manage their own as well as 3rd party digital services (Apps) at machine and plant level. NUPANO Lenze enables you to handle such Apps in an easy way - even with a growing installed base. It gives you full transparency on which App in which version is running on which machine.

  ## Technical concept 
  
  NUPANO consists of three parts:
  
  1. In the NUPANO cloud, machine builders manage all their machine fleet as all of their apps and assignment to specific machines. The cloud software part of NUPANO is a fully modular and dynamic multitenant microservice architecture
  
  2. NUPANO Connect securely connects a NUPANO Runtime to the cloud when a reconfiguration or update is needed. It is a Windows or Linux service that runs on the user's engineering PC.
  
  3. The NUPANO Runtime requires Docker infrastructure on an X86 64-bit architecture. It can be e.g. an Industry PC at machine and plant level where the machine-related apps are executed. 
  
  ## Runtime configuration
  
  The NUPANO runtime can be configured via environment variables.
